An OxPoints editor
==================

Here's a prototypical OxPoints editor. It currently supports editing entity
metadata, and listing entities. It doesn't yet support modifying relationships
or any other more-complicated operations.

It currently has bits hard-coded, so isn't going to deploy anywhere nicely. In
time this will be fixed.


How it works
------------

The application contains three models; File, Object and Relation. The latter two
contain metadata derived from the first and are maintained automagically by
File.save().

A File instance represents an OxPoints XML file on disk. When there are pending
changes, the user field is set to be the user owning the changes. This prevents
anyone else from editing that file (and its associated Objects).

When an OxPoints entity is edited, the relevant chunk of XML is pulled out of
File.xml and run through the forms.xsl stylesheet. This results in sets of
initial data to prepopulate some Django forms to show to the user. Each set of
initial data is accompanied by an XPath expression pointing at the element the
form is representing.

Each Django form has a serialize method that returns a chunk of XML to
transclude back into the original file.
